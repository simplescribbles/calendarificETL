# calendarificETL
ETL pipeline using Calendarific API, Python, SQLite, and Apache Airflow
This project was inspired by the fantastic Karolina Sowinska based on her recommendation in the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99UUaL_onqU

Karolina has a great four part video series where she walks through the ETL process using Spotify data. I took those same lectures and applied the logic to the Calendarific process.
